- 👋 Hi, I’m @An025 (Ani)


- 👀 I'm interested in back end, as it is the brain behind the program, as well as, in front end, as I think I have „sense of beauty” for design.
- 💞️ I really like programming and developing myself. I constantly learn new languages and technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Spring Boot.

- 👀 You can find self-study based projects before the start of the course of Codecool ( 2020 autumn).
- 👀 Several independent/team projekts from the past one year (most of them are private).
- and who knows what will come next...
